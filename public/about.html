<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I am Jens from Germany.</p>
<hr />
<p>I am basically an engineer of vehicle technologies, but I want to get some skills in web development.</p>
<p>I am interested in coding but haven't done so much on it so far.</p>
<p>I already have so many projects in my mind, that I want to do.</p>
<p>But until then it is still a long way to go.</p>
<p>I am happy to be in Angela's course and very excited what's coming up in the next tutorials.</p>
<p>So, let's keep on studying, practicing and on having fun on coding to achive our individual goals as soon as
  possible.</p>
